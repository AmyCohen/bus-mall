As a marketing professional, I want to fully understand what the potential customers want based on their preferences of items shown at a specific time.

As a rider of the Puget Sound bus system, I want to see visually appealing images/magazines that capture my interest.

As a potential customer, I want to see a wide range of items that I am interested in and less of what I don't care about.

As a developer, I want to randomize the product offering so the focus-group is presented with non-repeating items to base their choices on.

As a developer, I want to keep track of not only what they picked, but how many times they picked it, and how many times thaty viewed that image so I can give the marketing team the best information possible to create their product offerings.
